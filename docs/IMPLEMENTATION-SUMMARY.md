- ✅ Replaced `rg-prox01` with `YOUR_PROXMOX_HOST`
- ✅ All sensitive hostnames and paths now use placeholder variables

### 2. Secured CORS Configuration
**File:** `docker/services/idrac-manager/src/idrac-api-server.py`
- ✅ Removed wildcard CORS (`*`) settings
- ✅ Implemented configuration-based CORS with `api-config.json`
- ✅ Added origin validation logic
- ✅ Created secure default configuration

### 3. Enhanced Input Sanitization
**File:** `scripts/troubleshoot-vm-network.sh`
- ✅ Added timeout controls for `qm agent` and `qm guest` commands
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for command substitution
- ✅ Added input validation and sanitization

## 🛠️ Code Quality Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

### 1. Eliminated Code Duplication
**New File:** `scripts/utils/vm-network-utils.sh`
- ✅ Created shared utility functions for IP detection
- ✅ Standardized error handling across scripts
- ✅ Implemented reusable connectivity testing functions

**Updated Files:**
- ✅ `scripts/troubleshoot-vm-network.sh` - Now uses shared utilities
- ✅ `deploy/deploy-stack.sh` - Integrated shared IP detection
- ✅ `deploy/create-vm.sh` - Uses shared utilities with fallback

### 2. Improved Error Handling
**File:** `docker/services/idrac-manager/src/network-scanner.py`
- ✅ Added consecutive failure tracking
- ✅ Implemented recovery mode for persistent failures
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Enhanced logging and error reporting

### 3. Enhanced Configuration Management
**New File:** `docker/services/idrac-manager/config/api-config.json`
- ✅ Centralized API configuration
- ✅ Configurable CORS settings
- ✅ Security parameters (timeouts, rate limits)
- ✅ Logging configuration

## 📁 File Organization (LOW PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

### 1. Enhanced .gitignore
**File:** `.gitignore`
- ✅ Added homelab-specific file types (*.iso, *.qcow2, *.vmdk)
- ✅ Added VM and container data directories
- ✅ Added backup file patterns
- ✅ Added virtualization-specific extensions

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation
**New Files:**
- ✅ `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- ✅ `scripts/integration-check.sh` - Holistic integration validation

**Updated Files:**
- ✅ `README.md` - Added troubleshooting section and new documentation links

## 🔧 Integration and Testing

### 1. Shared Utility Integration
- ✅ All scripts now use consistent IP detection methods
- ✅ Standardized error handling and logging
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with fallback methods

### 2. Configuration Integration
- ✅ API server loads configuration from centralized file
- ✅ CORS settings are now environment-configurable
- ✅ Security parameters are externalized

### 3. Holistic Validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration check script
- ✅ Validates file structure, permissions, and syntax
- ✅ Tests shared utility integration
- ✅ Verifies security improvements
